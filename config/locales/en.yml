    jingles:
      q1: "What is Jinglr, and what is jingle?"
      a1: "A jingle is a short slogan, verse, or tune designed to be easily remembered. Jinglr allows users to create songs by mixing jingles uploaded by everyone. Let's say you're a guitarist and you come up with a cool little riff. You upload it, and then later a drummer listens to it and decides he wants to add on to it. Suddenly, you guys are collaborating!"
      q2: "How do I create a jingle?"
      a2: "Easy. Just record something, click the <span class='text-primary'>\"Create\"</span> button on the top left of your screen, upload it, write a short description (we suggest you give it some <span class='label bg-dark'>#hashtags</span>), and create. That's all there is to it."
      q3: "I found a jingle I want to add a track to. How do I do it?"
      a3: "Simple. You click the \"Add a Track\" button, then use the form to upload an audio file. It will be added to the track mixer right below the jingle you're adding a track to. You'll use the mixer to align the track (by clicking and dragging) to start when you want it to. This is useful, because while one person's jingle may start playing at the 1-second mark, maybe yours starts at the 2-second mark and you need to adjust things so they're synchronized. Once you're happy with it, add a description (again, we suggest you give it some <span class='label bg-dark'>#hashtags</span>) and create."
      q4: "Do I always have to upload new stuff to use Jinglr?"
      a4: "Nope. You can use the <span class='text-primary'>track mixer</span> to mix together existing jingles belonging to anyone else. We're not kidding when we call it collaborative. Think of it like what rappers do when they sample existing music to create new stuff."
      q5: "What are these \"jingle connections\" I see when viewing a jingle?"
      a5: "Ah, yes, that. It just shows you what things have been done with that jingle. Also, if it was created by mixing two existing jingles, it'll show you the originals."
      q6: "I heard a jingle I liked, and I want to be notified whenever more tracks are added to it."
      a6: "No problem. Click the little <i class='icon-bullhorn text-primary'></i> bullhorn button to be notified of when the jingle is updated. You can click it again to stop receiving notifications."
    mixer:
      q1: "What is the track mixer, and where can I find it?"
      a1: "The track mixer allows you to take two jingles and mix them together to create something new. If you heard, for example, a nice piano tune, and another person has a sweet voice that goes with it perfectly, you can add those two jingles to the track mixer and get to editing. The track mixer is found on the left sidebar of any page containing jingles."
      q2: "How do I use the track mixer?"
      a2: "After you have two tracks in there, you can click and drag tracks along the timeline to adjust their starting position. Preview your new jingle by clicking the play button. Once you're happy with it, add a description and create. The original creators of the jingles you used will be notified, so they'll be able to admire your work. <strong>Note:</strong> Due to browser inconsistencies, you should preview the mix a couple of times before committing to it, because the offsets may be off slightly the first or second play through. This is the highest-priority feature being worked on, so rest assured, it'll be fixed."
      q3: "I want to mix an existing jingle with an audio file I have."
      a3: "For that, click on <span class='text-primary'>\"Add a Track\"</span> when viewing the jingle. It'll bring up a track mixer that lets you upload a file."
    users:
      q1: "How do I edit my account?"
      a1: "You can click the <span class='text-primary'>\"Home\"</span> menu link on the left, then click <span class='text-primary'>\"Edit Account\"</span> in the sidebar menu. Or, you can click on your name on the top right of the page and then click the <span class='text-primary'>\"Account Settings\"</span> link."
      q2: "I'm tired of receiving so many notification emails. How can I control that?"
      a2: "Click the <span class='text-primary'>\"Home\"</span> menu link on the left, then the <span class='text-primary'>\"Notifications\"</span> link. From there, click the <span class='text-primary'>\"Settings\"</span> tab up top and go wild."
      q3: "I heard a jingle I really liked. Is there a way to save it?"
      a3: "You bet. Click the <i class='icon-heart text-primary'></i> heart button and the jingle will be added to your favorites list, which you can access from the <span class='text-primary'>\"Home\"</span> menu, then the sidebar. The owner of the jingle won't know you marked it as a favorite."
      q4: "So-and-so is a great musician. I want to follow them."
      a4: "You stalker, you. View their profile by clicking on their name or avatar, then click the <span class='text-primary'><i class='icon-bullhorn'></i> Follow</span> button."
    general:
      q1: "________ is not working. Nothing works. Ugh."
      a1: "Damn. That sucks. Bugs happen, and we'd appreciate it if you filled out a bug report and provide as much detail as possible, like what you were doing, what page you were on, your browser, operating system, etc. To report a bug, click on your name at the top right of the page and click <span class='text-primary'>\"Report a Problem\"</span>."
      q2: "Can you implement a feature I want?"
      a2: "We're always open to suggestions. Click on your name at the top right of the page and click <span class='text-primary'>\"Report a Problem\"</span>. Change the category to something more fitting, and submit your request. While we cannot guarantee anything, we'll definitely read through it and, if it's worthwile, make it happen."
