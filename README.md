### Jinglr

Collaborative songwriting. The app is up at http://jinglr.com if you'd like to play around with it.

I've decided to open source this for two reasons:

1) Why not?

2) I was never able to market this, nor did I have the time to continue development on this as better projects came along.

Have fun with it, and please let me know if anything comes from it!
